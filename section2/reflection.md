## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
-***MISTAKES ARE ESSENTIAL TO LEARNING:  As a climbing coach and a climber myself, failure is part of the process.  If it was easy, then everyone would do it.  Embracing the mistakes and failure is what makes success so rewarding.
* NOT BEING AFRAID TO SEEK HELP:  I can also relate this to climbing.  If I am working on a boulder problem and am having trouble to find creative ways to do a move successfully (especially if I continue to fall in that section) asking for help opens the door to a different perspective to help you move through what you are stuck on.***

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
-***I enjoy being challenged, wether it is to solve a problem or make it up a steep section of a hike.  I continue to learn and grow as I am challenged and that is important to me.  I want to work on asking questions if I am stuck instead of being stubborn and wanting to figure it out on my own - I am very aware that I need to work on this!***

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
-***I found myself frustrated when I could not get node to run correctly.  I reached out to a friend who is a current Turing student and we talked through it together.  After our discussion, I realized it was an easy solution.  I do not mind having to search for answers or problem solve on my own.  Problem solving simply supports learning, I will remember the process a lot easier, too!***

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
-***A conditional statement is involved in decision making - if/then/else will execute if the condition is met.  I would compare a conditional statement to backpacking: if a hike is under 10 miles, you will not need to set up camp.  If a hike is over 10 miles, you will need to set up camp. A conditional is probably used in an application like DuoLingo.  You have to score a certain amount to continue to the next lesson.***

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
-***To add multpiple conditions to an 'if' statement you would want to use logical operators.  There is Logical AND &&  which will read left to right so if it reads True True, the output will also be true.  Both conditions must be true for it to read true.  Any other combination of True and False will result as false.  We can also use an OR operator ||.  The OR operator will run true if one of the operands runs true.***

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
-***Being able to run NODE in the terminal was extremely helpful while adjusting the code in Atom also using logical operators.  You could also have a peer review it.***

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
-***When dealing with multiple variables in conditional statements - especially when one value is true or false, are logical operators the best option?***
