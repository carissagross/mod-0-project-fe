## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
- I think asking questions is really important even if you are determined to figure something out by yourself.  I noticed that I would work on something for a little over 25 minutes, then search for a solution for another 20 before asking for help from a classmate.  The solution was pretty simple and I realized really quickly that asking sooner is much better than later.  I learned so much in all of these exercises*

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
- **Number:**
Number data types include all numbers!  Numbers can be written as decimals but larger numbers do not include commas

- **String:**:
String data types consist of single (or a series) of letters, numbers, and/or characters (%$#@!).  Strings are always surrounded with "quotes" OR ``

- **Boolean:**
Boolean data types determine the values of TRUE or FALSE when a script runs.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
*var greeting = "Hello World!";*
*console.log = (greeting);*

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
- Two // (backslashes) and anything AFTER the backslashes will NOT run - this is also known as a single line comment.  Code comments allow us to add MORE information about the code for others!  You can also add multi-line comments which is (/*)

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
- A variable is a way to store information about a value that can be used in multiple places AND the variable can "vary" later on.  I would describe this to a five year old as them thinking about receiving a letter which is what we call the mail.  We can also receive boxes that also come in the mail.  Mail can be delivered as a letter or a box.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
- Instagram is an app I use frequently.  The boolean value would be if an image is liked (true or false)  The number data type would be the number of likes an image receives.  A string data type would hold the value of a special message announcing a sale on the website or even greeting you when you log into your account.  The string data type would be your instagram username or a photo description.


7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
- A way of joining strings together using the + sign

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
- From my understanding, when I log into my Discover account, up top it says "Good Afternoon, Carissa" I think this would be an example of a concatenation.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
-I would really like to see real life examples of these data types and values used on websites and apps.  I understand the concepts and why they are used, but I am so curious to see how it all comes together.  It is truly fascinating and that is how I learn.  I am also going to try googling what we went over to see if I am able to find examples.
