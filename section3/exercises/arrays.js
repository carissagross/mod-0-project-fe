Two examples are already completed. Your task is to complete
any remaining prompt.

Make sure to run the file with node in your command line.

//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
animals[0] = "Zebra";
console.log(animals[0]);


// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.

console.log(animals.length);


// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"

animals[2] = "Gorilla"
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.

animals[3] = "Monkey"
console.log(animals);


// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array

var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
animals[2] = "Elephant";
console.log(animals[2].toString());

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)

var foods = ['sweet potatoes', 'cauliflower', 'apples', 'onions']
console.log(foods.toString());


// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.

console.log(foods.length);


// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added

var count = foods.push('broccoli');
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
console.log(foods.pop());
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added

console.log(foods.unshift ("broccoli", "asasparagus", "mushrooms"));
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.

foods.shift('0');
console.log(foods);

//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.
// 1: I use the app Poshmark often and I have a closet that is esentially a list of the items in my closet.
// I create the item details which is where the lists would be created such as
// var closet = ["vintage colorado tee, teva sandals"];
// 2: I use Spotify often and I create my own playlists from different artists which is definitely
// a utilized list!
// 3: My To Do list in Apple notes


//-------------------
// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of the project
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 9;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "wall";

// variable greater than or equal to 15 will run true notifying the user they can call an Uber
// variable less than 15 will run false and continue to next conditional statement
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
  console.log("You can call an Uber");

// a variable equal to car & true will run true
// a variable not equal to car and true will run false and move to the next else statement
} else if (chargerType === "car" && hasCharger) {
 console.log("You can call an Uber");

// prompt will execute if all above conditions run false
// example: user does not have a charger
} else {
  console.log("You cannot call an Uber");
}


// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
