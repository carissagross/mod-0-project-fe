Array methods
1. pop() - pop will remove the last element from an array and return the same element which will also shorten the length of the array.
2. push() - push will add a new element to the end of an array and in result, will return the new length of the array.
3. shift() - shift removes the first element listed in an array and returns the same element that was removed, resulting in shortening the length of the array.
4. unshift() - unshift will add a new element or elements to the beginning of an array and the return results in a new array length.
